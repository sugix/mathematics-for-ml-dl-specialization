title: Linear Algebra

## Topics Covered

### Introduction

- Recall how machine learning and vectors and matrices are related
- Interpret how changes in the model parameters affect the quality of the fit to the training data
- Recognize that variations in the model parameters are vectors on the response surface - that vectors are a generic concept not limited to a physical real space
- Use substitution / elimination to solve a fairly easy linear algebra problem
- Understand how to add vectors and multiply by a scalar number


### Vectors are objects that move around space

- Calculate basic operations (dot product, modulus, negation) on vectors
- Calculate a change of basis
- Recall linear independence
- Identify a linearly independent basis and relate this to the dimensionality of the space

### Matrices in Linear Algebra: Objects that operate on Vectors

- Understand what a matrix is and how it corresponds to a transformation.
- Explain and calculate inverse and determinant of matrices
- Identify and explain how to find inverses computationally and what goes wrong.

### Matrices Make Linear Mappings

- Identify matrices as operators
- Relate the transformation matrix to a set of new basis vectors
- Formulate code for mappings based on these transformation matrices
- Write code to find an orthonormal basis set computationally

### Eigen Value and Eigenvectors

- Identify geometrically what an eigenvector/value is
- Apply mathematical formulation in simple cases
- Build an intuition of larger dimention eigensystems
- Write code to solve a large dimentional eigen problem
