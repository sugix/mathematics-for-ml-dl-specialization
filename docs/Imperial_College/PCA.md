## Core Concepts

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is one of the most important dimensionality reduction algorithms in machine learning.

### Statistics of Datasets

- Compute basic statistics of data sets
- Interpret the effects of linear transformations on means and (co)variances
- Compute means/variances of linearly transformed data sets
- Write code that represents images as vectors
- Write code that computes basic statistics of datasets

### Inner Products


- Explain inner products
- Compute angles and distances using inner products
- Write code that computes distances and angles between images
- Demonstrate an understanding of properties of inner products
- Discover that orthogonality depends on the inner product


### Orthogonal Projections

- Compute orthogonal projections using different inner products
- Relate projections to the reconstruction error and compute it
- Write code that projects image data onto a 2-dimensional subspace

### Principal Component Analysis

- Summarize PCA
- Write code that implements PCA
- Assess the properties of PCA when applying to high-dimensional data
